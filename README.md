# m8

## To Do

- Switch to `OpenGL` for graphics and a basic *engine* to display some debug information beside the game window.
  It would be awesome to have everything in like a retro-style 8bit graphics, maybe with colors for everything other
  than the CHIP8 display.
- Debug Space Invaders, or try another rom.
- Add a basic sound engine, `SDL2_mixer` looks like a good fit.
